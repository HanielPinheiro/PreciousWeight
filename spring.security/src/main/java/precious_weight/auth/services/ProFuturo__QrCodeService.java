 /*
          Explanation of theory from https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/

        //Polynomial long division
        /**
           Overall, the steps of polynomial long division are:

              Find the appropriate term to multiply the divisor by. The result of the multiplication should have the same first term as the the dividend (in the first multiplication step) or remainder (in all subsequent multiplication steps).
              Subtract the result from the dividend (in the first multiplication step) or remainder (in all subsequent multiplication steps).
              Repeat steps 1 and 2 until it is no longer possible to multiply by an integer, or in other words, it would be necessary to multiply by a fraction. The number at the bottom of the tableau is the remainder.

           The polynomial long division necessary for Reed-Solomon Error Correction is simpler in some ways than this example, because it will not be necessary to deal with the exponents of the polynomial terms.

        // Step 3: Understand The Galois Field
        // To generate error correction codewords, this process uses a method called Reed-Solomon Error correction
        // Along with polynomial long division, this method uses a Galois field (256), which is essentially a restricted set of numbers, as well as some mathematical operations that create numbers that are still in that set.
        //  The numbers in GF(256) will all be in the range of 0 through 255 (inclusive).
        /**
          In the Galois Field, negative numbers have the same value as positive numbers, so -n = n.
          This means that addition and subtraction within the Galois Field are the same thing.
          Addition and subtraction in the Galois Field are performed by doing the addition or subtraction as normal, but then performing the modulo operation.
          And since we are using bit-wise modulo 2 arithmetic (as mentioned in the QR code specification), this is the same as performing the XOR operation.
          1 + 1 = 2. 2 % 2 = 0 -> The same of: 1 XOR(+ or -) 1 = 0
          0 + 1 = 1. 1 % 2 = 1 -> 0 XOR(^) 1 = 1

        //Step 5: Generate Powers of 2 using Byte-Wise Modulo 100011101
        /**
          All of the numbers in GF(256) can be represented as a power of 2.
          Specifically, all numbers in GF(256) can be represented as 2n, where 0 <= n <= 255.
          2 power 8 would seem to be too big for the Galois Field since it is equal to 256.
          The QR code specification says to use byte-wise modulo 100011101 arithmetic
          (where 100011101 is a binary number that is equivalent to 285 in decimal).
          This means that when a number is 256 or larger, it should be XORed with 285.
          This leads to unexpected values for 2 power 8 and larger.
          28 = 256. 256 > 255. 256 ^(XORed) 285 = 29
          When continuing on to 2 power 9, do not take its usual value of 512 and XOR with 285
          (which would result in too large a number anyway). Do it: 2 power 9 = 2 power 8 * 2.
          2 power 9 = 2 power 8 * 2 -> 29 (equivalent to 256 ^(XORed) 285) * 2 = 58
          Continue using the previous power of 2 to create the next powers of 2:
          2 power 10 = 2 power 9 * 2 = 58 * 2 = 116
          2 power11 = 2 power 10 * 2 = 116 * 2 = 232
          Whenever a value greater than or equal to 256 is obtained, once again XOR with 285:
          2 power 12 = 2 power 11 * 2 = 232 * 2 = 464. 464 >255 -> 464 ^ 285 = 205
          In general, the values are always equal to 2 times the previous power, and if that value is 256 or greater, it is XORed with 285.


        //Step 6: Understand Multiplication with Logs and Antilogs
        /**
          Because all of the values can be represented with 2n as explained above,
          it is possible to logs and antilogs to simplify multiplication in GF(256).
          one can multiply two numbers p and q with the following operation: b power (logb p + logb q)
          In this case, base 2 is in use, so the above operation becomes 2 power (log2 p + log2 q)
          The log2 x operation tells us how many times to multiply 2 to get an answer of x.
          In other words, it determines n where 2 power n = x. n = log2 p + log2 q
          This provides a shortcut for multiplying numbers in GF(256): 2 pow 2 * 2 pow 8 = 2 pow (2 + 8) = 2 pow 10
          And by this, we can discover all values of numbers in GF(256), based on Bitwise Modulo rule


        //Step 7: Understanding The Generator Polynomial
        /**
          As mentioned earlier, error correction coding uses polynomial long division.
          To do that, two polynomials are needed. The first polynomial to use is called
          the message polynomial.Uses the data codewords from the data encoding step as
          its coefficients.
          If the data codewords, converted to integers, were 25, 218, and 35,
          message polynomial would be 25x2 + 218x + 35.
          The message polynomial will be divided by a GeneratorPolynomial.
          The generator polynomial is a polynomial that is created by multiplying
          (x - ɑ0) ... (x - ɑn-1) where n is the number of error correction codewords
          that must be generated. (alpha) is equal to 2.
          So, need a function to generate dividend polynomial from a block in alpha notation
          Need a function to generate divisorpolynomial to divide based in value of error code per block
          NeededPolynomial = Dividend / Divisor;
          ****When we multiply two alpha values, normally we add the two exponents together.
          But if the result is bigger than 255, we have a problem.
          To prevent that we put the resulting exponent through the following formula:
                        (exponent % 256) + floor(exponent / 256)
          ****When adding terms in base of X during the creation of a generator polynomial,
          you must always XOR the integers rather than adding them.
